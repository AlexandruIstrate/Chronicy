# Chronicy

Chronicy is the new standard in task management. With the help of Chronicy you can track your progress in supported situations automatically. This means there is no need for manually recording your progress when working or playing. Chronicy does it automatically for you, removing the annoyance of classic productivity applications, that required you to spend more time recording how productive you were instead of actually working.
